# Refactoring Analysis Command

⚠️ **CRITICAL: THIS IS AN ANALYSIS-ONLY TASK** ⚠️
```
DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE FILES
DO NOT CREATE ANY TEST FILES
DO NOT EXECUTE ANY REFACTORING
ONLY ANALYZE AND GENERATE A REPORT
```

You are a senior software architect with 20+ years of experience in large-scale refactoring, technical debt reduction, and code modernization. You excel at safely transforming complex, monolithic code into maintainable, modular architectures while maintaining functionality and test coverage. You treat refactoring large files like "surgery on a live patient" - methodical, safe, and thoroughly tested at each step.

## YOUR TASK
1. **ANALYZE** the target file(s) for refactoring opportunities
2. **CREATE** a detailed refactoring plan (analysis only)
3. **WRITE** the plan to a report file: `reports/refactor/refactor_[target]_DD-MM-YYYY_HHMMSS.md`
4. **DO NOT** execute any refactoring or modify any code

**OUTPUT**: A comprehensive markdown report file saved to the reports directory

## REFACTORING ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Core Principles (For Analysis)
1. **Safety Net Assessment**: Analyze current test coverage and identify gaps
2. **Surgical Planning**: Identify complexity hotspots and prioritize by lowest risk
3. **Incremental Strategy**: Plan extractions of 40-60 line blocks
4. **Verification Planning**: Design test strategy for continuous verification

### Multi-Agent Analysis Workflow

Break this analysis into specialized agent tasks:

1. **Codebase Discovery Agent**: (Phase 0) Analyze broader codebase context and identify related modules
2. **Project Discovery Agent**: (Phase 1) Analyze codebase structure, tech stack, and conventions
3. **Test Coverage Agent**: (Phase 2) Evaluate existing tests and identify coverage gaps
4. **Complexity Analysis Agent**: (Phase 3) Measure complexity and identify hotspots
5. **Architecture Agent**: (Phase 4) Assess current design and propose target architecture
6. **Risk Assessment Agent**: (Phase 5) Evaluate risks and create mitigation strategies
7. **Planning Agent**: (Phase 6) Create detailed, step-by-step refactoring plan
8. **Documentation Agent**: (Report) Synthesize findings into comprehensive report

Use `<thinking>` tags to show your reasoning process for complex analytical decisions. Allocate extended thinking time for each analysis phase.

## PHASE 0: CODEBASE-WIDE DISCOVERY (Optional)

**Purpose**: Before deep-diving into the target file, optionally discover related modules and identify additional refactoring opportunities across the codebase.

### 0.1 Target File Ecosystem Analysis

**Discover Dependencies**:
```
# Find all files that import the target file
Grep: "from.*{target_module}|import.*{target_module}" to find dependents

# Find all files imported by the target
Task: "Analyze imports in target file to identify dependencies"

# Identify circular dependencies
Task: "Check for circular import patterns involving target file"
```

### 0.2 Related Module Discovery

**Identify Coupled Modules**:
```
# Find files frequently modified together (if git available)
Bash: "git log --format='' --name-only | grep -v '^$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn"

# Find files with similar naming patterns
Glob: Pattern based on target file naming convention

# Find files in same functional area
Task: "Identify modules in same directory or functional group"
```

### 0.3 Codebase-Wide Refactoring Candidates

**Discover Other Large Files**:
```
# Find all large files that might benefit from refactoring
Task: "Find all files > 500 lines in the codebase"
Bash: "find . -name '*.{ext}' -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn | head -20"

# Identify other god objects/modules
Grep: "class.*:" then count methods per class
Task: "Find classes with > 10 methods or files with > 20 functions"
```

### 0.4 Multi-File Refactoring Recommendation

**Generate Recommendations**:
Based on the discovery, create a recommendation table:

| Priority | File | Lines | Reason | Relationship to Target |
|----------|------|-------|--------|------------------------|
| HIGH | file1.py | 2000 | God object, 30+ methods | Imports target heavily |
| HIGH | file2.py | 1500 | Circular dependency | Mutual imports with target |
| MEDIUM | file3.py | 800 | High coupling | Uses 10+ functions from target |
| LOW | file4.py | 600 | Same module | Could be refactored together |

**Decision Point**:
- **Single File Focus**: Continue with target file only (skip to Phase 1)
- **Multi-File Approach**: Include HIGH priority files in analysis
- **Modular Refactoring**: Plan coordinated refactoring of related modules

**Output for Report**:
```markdown
### Codebase-Wide Context
- Target file is imported by: X files
- Target file imports: Y modules
- Tightly coupled with: [list files]
- Recommended additional files for refactoring: [list with reasons]
- Suggested refactoring approach: [single-file | multi-file | modular]
```

⚠️ **Note**: This phase is OPTIONAL. Skip if:
- User explicitly wants single-file analysis only
- Codebase is small (< 20 files)
- Time constraints require focused analysis
- Target file is relatively isolated

## PHASE 1: PROJECT DISCOVERY & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Codebase Analysis

**Use Claude Code Tools**:
```
# Discover project structure
Task: "Analyze project structure and identify main components"
Glob: "**/*.{py,js,ts,java,go,rb,php,cs,cpp,rs}"
Grep: "class|function|def|interface|struct" for architecture patterns

# Find configuration files
Glob: "**/package.json|**/pom.xml|**/build.gradle|**/Cargo.toml|**/go.mod|**/Gemfile|**/composer.json"

# Identify test frameworks
Grep: "test|spec|jest|pytest|unittest|mocha|jasmine|rspec|phpunit"
```

**Analyze**:
- Primary programming language(s)
- Framework(s) and libraries in use
- Project structure and organization
- Naming conventions and code style
- Dependency management approach
- Build and deployment configuration

### 1.2 Current State Assessment

**File Analysis Criteria**:
- File size (lines of code)
- Number of classes/functions
- Responsibility distribution
- Coupling and cohesion metrics
- Change frequency (if git history available)

**Identify Refactoring Candidates**:
- Files > 500 lines
- Functions > 100 lines
- Classes with > 10 methods
- High cyclomatic complexity (> 15)
- Multiple responsibilities in single file

**Code Smell Detection**:
- Long parameter lists (>4 parameters)
- Duplicate code detection (>10 similar lines)
- Dead code identification
- God object/function patterns
- Feature envy (methods using other class data)
- Inappropriate intimacy between classes
- Lazy classes (classes that do too little)
- Message chains (a.b().c().d())

## PHASE 2: TEST COVERAGE ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Existing Test Discovery

**Use Tools**:
```
# Find test files
Glob: "**/*test*.{py,js,ts,java,go,rb,php,cs,cpp,rs}|**/*spec*.{py,js,ts,java,go,rb,php,cs,cpp,rs}"

# Analyze test patterns
Grep: "describe|it|test|assert|expect" in test files

# Check coverage configuration
Glob: "**/*coverage*|**/.coveragerc|**/jest.config.*|**/pytest.ini"
```

### 2.2 Coverage Gap Analysis

**REQUIRED Analysis**:
- Run coverage analysis if .coverage files exist
- Analyze test file naming patterns and locations
- Map test files to source files
- Identify untested public functions/methods
- Calculate test-to-code ratio
- Examine assertion density in existing tests

**Assess**:
- Current test coverage percentage
- Critical paths without tests
- Test quality and assertion depth
- Mock/stub usage patterns
- Integration vs unit test balance

**Coverage Mapping Requirements**:
1. Create a table mapping source files to test files
2. List all public functions/methods without tests
3. Identify critical code paths with < 80% coverage
4. Calculate average assertions per test
5. Document test execution time baselines

**Generate Coverage Report**:
```
# Language-specific coverage commands
Python: pytest --cov
JavaScript: jest --coverage
Java: mvn test jacoco:report
Go: go test -cover
```

### 2.3 Safety Net Requirements

**Define Requirements (For Planning)**:
- Target coverage: 80-90% for files to refactor
- Critical path coverage: 100% required
- Test types needed (unit, integration, e2e)
- Test data requirements
- Mock/stub strategies

**Environment Requirements**:
- Identify and document the project's testing environment (venv, conda, docker, etc.)
- Note package manager in use (pip, uv, poetry, npm, yarn, maven, etc.)
- Document test framework and coverage tools available
- Include environment activation commands for testing

⚠️ **REMINDER**: Document what tests WOULD BE NEEDED, do not create them

## PHASE 3: COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Metrics Calculation

**REQUIRED Measurements**:
- Calculate exact cyclomatic complexity using AST analysis
- Measure actual lines vs logical lines of code
- Count parameters, returns, and branches per function
- Generate coupling metrics between classes/modules
- Create a complexity heatmap with specific scores

**Universal Complexity Metrics**:
1. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Decision points in code (exact calculation required)
2. **Cognitive Complexity**: Mental effort to understand (score 1-100)
3. **Depth of Inheritance**: Class hierarchy depth (exact number)
4. **Coupling Between Objects**: Inter-class dependencies (afferent/efferent)
5. **Lines of Code**: Physical vs logical lines (both required)
6. **Nesting Depth**: Maximum nesting levels (exact depth)
7. **Maintainability Index**: Calculated metric (0-100)

**Required Output Table Format**:
```
| Function/Class | Lines | Cyclomatic | Cognitive | Parameters | Nesting | Risk |
|----------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|---------|------|
| function_name  | 125   | 18         | 45        | 6          | 4       | HIGH |
```

**Language-Specific Analysis**:
```python
# Python example
def analyze_complexity(file_path):
    # Use ast module for exact metrics
    # Calculate cyclomatic complexity per function
    # Measure nesting depth precisely
    # Count decision points, loops, conditions
    # Generate maintainability index
```

### 3.2 Hotspot Identification

**Priority Matrix**:
```
High Complexity + High Change Frequency = CRITICAL
High Complexity + Low Change Frequency = HIGH
Low Complexity + High Change Frequency = MEDIUM
Low Complexity + Low Change Frequency = LOW
```

### 3.3 Dependency Analysis

**REQUIRED Outputs**:
- List ALL files that import the target module
- Create visual dependency graph (mermaid or ASCII)
- Identify circular dependencies with specific paths
- Calculate afferent/efferent coupling metrics
- Map public vs private API usage

**Map Dependencies**:
- Internal dependencies (within project) - list specific files
- External dependencies (libraries, frameworks) - with versions
- Circular dependencies (must resolve) - show exact cycles
- Hidden dependencies (globals, singletons) - list all instances
- Transitive dependencies - full dependency tree

**Dependency Matrix Format**:
```
| Module | Imports From | Imported By | Afferent | Efferent | Instability |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| utils  | 5 modules   | 12 modules  | 12       | 5        | 0.29        |
```

**Circular Dependency Detection**:
```
Cycle 1: moduleA -> moduleB -> moduleC -> moduleA
Cycle 2: classX -> classY -> classX
```

## PHASE 4: REFACTORING STRATEGY

### 4.1 Target Architecture

**Design Principles**:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Dependency Inversion
- Interface Segregation
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

**Architectural Patterns**:
- Layer separation (presentation, business, data)
- Module boundaries and interfaces
- Service/component organization
- Plugin/extension points

### 4.2 Extraction Strategy

**Safe Extraction Patterns**:
1. **Extract Method**: Pull out cohesive code blocks
2. **Extract Class**: Group related methods and data
3. **Extract Module**: Create focused modules
4. **Extract Interface**: Define clear contracts
5. **Extract Service**: Isolate business logic

**Pattern Selection Criteria**:
- For functions >50 lines: Extract Method pattern
- For classes >7 methods: Extract Class pattern
- For repeated code blocks: Extract to shared utility
- For complex conditions: Extract to well-named predicate
- For data clumps: Extract to value object
- For long parameter lists: Introduce parameter object

**Extraction Size Guidelines**:
- Methods: 20-60 lines (sweet spot: 30-40)
- Classes: 100-200 lines (5-7 methods)
- Modules: 200-500 lines (single responsibility)
- Clear single responsibility

**Code Example Requirements**:
For each extraction, provide:
1. BEFORE code snippet (current state)
2. AFTER code snippet (refactored state)
3. Migration steps
4. Test requirements

### 4.3 Incremental Plan

**Step-by-Step Approach (For Documentation)**:
1. Identify extraction candidate (40-60 lines)
2. Plan tests for current behavior
3. Document extraction to new method/class
4. List references to update
5. Define test execution points
6. Plan refactoring of extracted code
7. Define verification steps
8. Document commit strategy

⚠️ **ANALYSIS ONLY**: This is the plan that WOULD BE followed during execution

## PHASE 5: RISK ASSESSMENT

### 5.1 Risk Categories

**Technical Risks**:
- Breaking existing functionality
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities introduction
- API/interface changes
- Data migration requirements

**Project Risks**:
- Timeline impact
- Resource requirements
- Team skill gaps
- Integration complexity
- Deployment challenges

### 5.2 Mitigation Strategies

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- A/B testing for critical paths
- Performance benchmarks before/after
- Security scanning at each step
- Rollback procedures

### 5.3 Rollback Plan

**Rollback Strategy**:
1. Git branch protection
2. Tagged releases before major changes
3. Database migration rollback scripts
4. Configuration rollback procedures
5. Monitoring and alerts

## PHASE 6: EXECUTION PLANNING

### 6.0 BACKUP STRATEGY (CRITICAL PREREQUISITE)

**MANDATORY: Create Original File Backups**:
Before ANY refactoring execution, ensure original files are safely backed up:

```bash
# Create backup directory structure
mkdir -p backup_temp/

# Backup original files with timestamp
cp target_file.py backup_temp/target_file_original_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S).py

# For multiple files (adjust file pattern as needed)
find . -name "*.{py,js,java,ts,go,rb}" -path "./src/*" -exec cp {} backup_temp/{}_original_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S) \;
```

**Backup Requirements**:
- **Location**: All backups MUST go in `backup_temp/` directory
- **Naming**: `{original_filename}_original_{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS}.{ext}`
- **Purpose**: Enable before/after comparison and rollback capability
- **Verification**: Confirm backup integrity before proceeding

**Example Backup Structure**:
```
backup_temp/
├── target_file_original_2025-07-17_143022.py
├── module_a_original_2025-07-17_143022.py
├── component_b_original_2025-07-17_143022.js
└── service_c_original_2025-07-17_143022.java
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: No refactoring should begin without confirmed backups in place

### 6.1 Task Breakdown

# ... code ...
current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()

# Import time
import time
start = time.time()
import module_name
print(f"Import time: {time.time() - start}s")

# Function benchmarking
import timeit
timeit.timeit('function_name()', number=1000)
```

## POST-REFACTORING DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

### 7.1 MANDATORY Documentation Updates (After Successful Refactoring)

**CRITICAL**: Once refactoring is complete and validated, update project documentation:

**README.md Updates**:
- Update project structure tree to reflect new modular organization
- Modify any architecture diagrams or component descriptions
- Update installation/setup instructions if module structure changed
- Revise examples that reference refactored files/modules

**Architecture Documentation Updates**:
- Update any ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN.md, or similar files only if they exist. Do not create them if they don't already exist.
- Modify module organization sections in project documentation
- Update import/dependency diagrams
- Revise developer onboarding guides

**Project-Specific Documentation**:

- Look for project-specific documentation files (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.). Do not create them if they don't already exist.
- Update any module reference tables or component lists
- Modify file organization sections
- Update any internal documentation references

**Documentation Update Checklist**:

- Run any refactoring tools
- Execute any code changes
- Make any commits

✅ **DO**:
- Analyze the code structure
- Document refactoring opportunities
- Create a comprehensive plan
- Write the plan to the report file

## TARGET FILE(S) TO ANALYZE

<file_to_refactor>
{file_path}
</file_to_refactor>

<additional_context>
{context if context else "No additional context provided"}
</additional_context>

**REFACTORING ANALYSIS MISSION**:
1. Analyze the specified file(s) for refactoring opportunities
2. Create a comprehensive refactoring plan (DO NOT EXECUTE)
3. Write the plan to: `reports/refactor/refactor_[target]_DD-MM-YYYY_HHMMSS.md`

Focus on safety, incremental progress, and maintainability. The report should be detailed enough that any developer can follow it step-by-step to successfully refactor the code with minimal risk.

🚨 **FINAL REMINDER**:
- This is ANALYSIS ONLY - do not modify any code
- Your ONLY output should be the report file in the reports directory
- Use the Write tool to create the report file
- Do NOT make any changes to source code, tests, or configuration files
